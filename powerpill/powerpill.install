==> WARNING: Versions prior to 2013.9.19 downloaded explicitly specified
             packages to the sync database directory when refreshing the
             databases (e.g. "powerpill -Syu foo" would download foo to
             /var/lib/pacman/sync/.) This has been corrected now but you
             should run "rm /var/lib/pacman/sync/*.pkg.*" to remove any
             extraneous packages.
